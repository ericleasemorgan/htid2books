INTRODUCTION
IN offering this little book to the public, I am glad to
take the opportunity of recording the pleasure I
have received at the appreciation its predecessor
has met with, as attested by its wide circulation, and by
the universally kind notices of it from the press. To
have been the means of administering innocent mirth
to thousands, may surely be a just motive for satisfac-
tion, and an excuse for grateful expression.
At the same time I am desirous of adding a few
words as to the history of the previously published
volume, viz., the first or original" Book of Nonsense,"
relating to which many absurd reports have crept into
circulation, such as that it was the composition of the
late Lord Brougham, the late Earl of Derby, etc.; that
the rhymes and pictures are by different persons; or
that the whole have a symbolical meaning, etc.;
whereas, every one of the Rhymes was composed by
myself, and every one of the Illustrations drawn by my
own hand at the time the verses were made. Moreover,
in no portion of these Nonsense drawings have I ever
allowed any caricature of private or public persons to
appear, and throughout, more care than might be
supposed has been given to make the subjects incapable


INTRODUCTION
of misinterpretation: "Nonsense," pure and absolute,
having been my aim throughout.
As for the persistently absurd report of the late
Earl of Derby being the author of the first "Book of
Nonsense," I may relate an incident which occurred to
me four summers ago, the first that gave me any insight
into the origin of the rumour.
I was on my way from London to Guildford, in a
railway carriage, containing, besides myself, one
passenger, an elderly gentleman. Presently, however,
two ladies entered, accompanied by two little boys.
These, who had just had a copy of the "Book of
Nonsense" given them, were loud in their delight,
and by degrees infected the whole party with their
mirth.
"How grateful," said the old gentleman to the two
ladies, "all children, and parents too, ought to be to
the statesman who has given his time to composing
that charming book!"
(The ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was I, the
author.)
"Do you not know who is the writer of it?"
asked the gentleman.
"The name is 'Edward Lear,'" said one of the
ladies.
"Ah," said the first speaker, "so it is printed;
but that is only a whim of the real author, the Earl of
Derby. 'Edward' is his Christian name, and, as you
may see, Lear is only Earl transposed."
"But," said the lady doubtingly, "here is a
dedication to the great-grandchildren, grand-nephews,


INTRODUCTION
and grand-nieces of Edward, thirteenth Earl of Derby,
by the author, Edward Lear."
"That," replied the other, "is simply a piece of
mystification; I am in a position to know that the
whole book was composed and illustrated by Lord
Derby himself. In fact, there is no such a person at all
as Edward Lear."
"Yet," said the other lady, " some friends of mine
tell me they know Mr. Lear."
"Quite a mistake! Completely a mistake !" said
the old gentleman, becoming rather angry at the con-
tradiction. "I am well aware of what I am saying.
I can inform you, no such person as ' Edward Lear'
exists!"
Hitherto I had kept silence; but as my hat was, as
well as my handkerchief and stick, largely marked
inside with my name, and as I happened to have in my
pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation
was too great to resist; so, flashing all these articles at
once on my would-be extinguisher's attention, I
speedily reduced him to silence.
Long years ago, in days when much of my time
was passed in a country house, where children and
mirth abounded, the lines beginning, "There was an
old man of Tobago," were suggested to me by a
valued friend, as a form of verse lending itself to
limitless variety for Rhymes and Pictures; and
thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings
and verses for the first "Book of Nonsense" were
struck off with a pen, no assistance ever having been
given me in any way but that of uproarious delight


INTRODUCTION
and welcome at the appearance of every new
absurdity.
Most of these Drawings and Rhymes were
reproduced and issued in the original "Book of
Nonsense." But many editions of that work having
been exhausted, and the call for it still continuing, I
added a considerable number of subjects to those
previously published, and these form the present
volume.
